HTML as a rust function!

## Maintenance status

I made this project for my personal use. I'll be happy if it can be useful to anyone else, but there are a few things to keep in mind:
* I only write documentation for my "future self", which may not be enough for people who are not in my head.
* The project may never be "feature complete" as I only add new features when I need them.

That being said, I also welcome suggestions and contributions.

## MSRV

The minimum supported rust version is currently `1.80`.

It will be updated when required, and that will not be considered a breaking change (it can happen in a minor version).
